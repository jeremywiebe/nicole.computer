I'm a software engineer and people person. I think we build better things when we have better conversations.

You might not know me but I bet you know my work, I've had the pleasure of working at Khan Academy, Everlane, and ModCloth amonst others. I've built servers, web frontends, web apps, mobile apps, parsers and a couple of wild hacks.

❤️ From Boulder Colorado
